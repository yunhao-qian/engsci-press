The core dictionary fully meets my objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Start-up is extraordinary fast, loading nearly 200,000 entries in less than 0.2 second.
	
	\item It occupies 230M memory (shown in Figure \ref{fig:memory_consumption}), about 30\% less than the Python version.
	
	\item Users can load a \texttt{.csv} file by typing a single line. This step can be automated by adding the command to a pre-run script.
\end{enumerate}

The story writer has more room for improvement:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Out of my expectation, many obscure words in the dictionary are not recognized by Microsoft Word, which is shown in Figure \ref{fig:word_spell_checker}. As a result, the grammar checker fails to analyse their part-of-speech properties or report errors. In spite of this, I find hardly any grammar mistakes by inspection.
	
	\item Frequent obscure words (especially biological terminology) also make the generated sentences challenging to understand.
	
	\item Output length control is not precise enough as a result of Poisson sampling. Deviation is up to 50\%.
\end{enumerate}

Screen recordings of running programs are archived in a Google Drive folder \cite{bib:engsci_press_media}, and a sample of story writer output are attached in Appendix \ref{sec:sample_output}.
